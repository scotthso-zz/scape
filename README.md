# Scape

Constanlty surrounded by the noise and pollution of our environment, it is often tough to breath, step back and enjoy nature. To be constanlty badgered by technology I often find myself wanting to escape from it. There is something poetic about building nature with the very thing that I want to escape from. 

Using the random midpoint displacement fractal algorithm the mountains are never the same just like in nature.

The stars are randomly generated to be at different speeds and opacity.

I used a full screen library to allow the user to be completely immersed.
